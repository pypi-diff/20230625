 # airoboros: using large language models to fine-tune large language models
 
 This is my take on implementing the [Self-Instruct paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560).  The approach is quite heavily modified, and does not use any human-generated seeds.
 
 This updated implementation supports either the /v1/completions endpoint or /v1/chat/completions, which is particularly useful in that it supports gpt-4 and gpt-3.5-turbo (which is 1/10 the cost of text-davinci-003).
 
 
 ## Key differences
 
 * support for either /v1/completions or /v1/chat/completions APIs (which allows gpt-3.5-turbo instead of text-davinci-003, as well as gpt-4 if you have access)
 * support for custom topics list, custom topic generation prompt, or completely random topics
-* sn memory vector db (Chroma) for similarity comparison, which is much faster than calculating rouge score for each generated instruction
+* in-memory vector db (Chroma) for similarity comparison, which is much faster than calculating rouge score for each generated instruction
 * (seemingly) better prompts, which includes injection of random topics to relate the instructions to, which creates much more diverse synthetic instructions
 * multi-threaded producer/consumer implementation for significantly faster runtimes (generally 150+ unique prompts per minute, more initially since there are fewer duplicates, decreasing over time).
 * tries to ensure the context, if provided, is relevant to the topic and contains all the information that would be necessary to respond to the instruction, and nost just a link to article/etc.
 * generally speaking, this implementation tries to reduce some of the [noise](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/issues/65)

 This updated implementation supports either the /v1/completions endpoint or /v1/chat/completions, which is particularly useful in that it supports gpt-4 and gpt-3.5-turbo (which is 1/10 the cost of text-davinci-003).
 
 
 ## Key differences
 
 * support for either /v1/completions or /v1/chat/completions APIs (which allows gpt-3.5-turbo instead of text-davinci-003, as well as gpt-4 if you have access)
 * support for custom topics list, custom topic generation prompt, or completely random topics
-* sn memory vector db (Chroma) for similarity comparison, which is much faster than calculating rouge score for each generated instruction
+* in-memory vector db (Chroma) for similarity comparison, which is much faster than calculating rouge score for each generated instruction
 * (seemingly) better prompts, which includes injection of random topics to relate the instructions to, which creates much more diverse synthetic instructions
 * multi-threaded producer/consumer implementation for significantly faster runtimes (generally 150+ unique prompts per minute, more initially since there are fewer duplicates, decreasing over time).
 * tries to ensure the context, if provided, is relevant to the topic and contains all the information that would be necessary to respond to the instruction, and nost just a link to article/etc.
 * generally speaking, this implementation tries to reduce some of the [noise](https://github.com/tloen/alpaca-lora/issues/65)

 Since the returned topics may include duplicates, it is not guaranteed that your topic list will contain 100 * 10 topics.
